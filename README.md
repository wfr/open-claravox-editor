# open-claravox-editor
Graphical editor for the Moog Claravox theremin.

A musical instrument that's supposed to be built for a lifetime should not
depend on proprietary software. Who knows if Moog will still maintain their
software 10, 20 years from now? Apart from that, they're not providing a Linux
version and likely never will. Hence this project.
